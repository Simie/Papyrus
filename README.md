Papyrus
=======

Papyrus is a toolset for creating a **mod-friendly** data system for your game.

It is split into two parts:

* Papyrus.Core provides methods for loading/combining plugin data.

* Papyrus.Studio is a WPF class library for editing Papyrus plugins, based on the [Gemini](https://github.com/tgjones/gemini) open-source IDE.

#### Status

Papyrus is being used in an upcoming game using the Unity engine, but is intended to become a viable library for other games too.
It is currently undergoing a major rewrite, taking on board lessons learnt from v1.

Papyrus.Core has been rewritten from the ground up, with unit testing and robustness as the primary goal. 
Papyrus.Studio is currently using code hacked in from the previous version, and is not up to the standard I would like yet.

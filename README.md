Papyrus
=======

Papyrus is a toolset for creating a **mod-friendly** data system for your game.

It is split into two parts:

* Papyrus.Core provides methods for loading/combining plugin data.

* Papyrus.Studio is a WPF class library based on the [Gemini](https://github.com/tgjones/gemini) open-source IDE for editing Papyrus plugins.

Status
=======

Papyrus has is currently undergoing a major rewrite. 

Papyrus.Core has been rewritten from the ground up, with unit testing and robustness as the primary goal. 
Papyrus.Studio is currently using code hacked from the previous version, and is not up to the standard I would like yet.
